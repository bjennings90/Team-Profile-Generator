# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

In this project I have created back-end and front-end work. In back-end I have created tests in order to write my code for this project. After all tests pass, I then wrote the html to display cards representing a manager, engineer, and intern and their descripters. When prompts appear in the terminal to fill out each card, once done the html file generates.
